# ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning â€“ APS Failure Dataset

This document summarizes the data cleaning process performed on the Scania APS Failure Dataset before Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

## ðŸ“Œ Steps Performed

1. **Handled missing values**
   - Original dataset contained `"na"` strings for missing values.
   - Replaced `"na"` with proper `NULL` values.

2. **Type conversion**
   - All sensor columns (except `class`) were originally stored as `STRING`.
   - Converted to `FLOAT`, rounded, and finally cast to `BIGINT` for consistency.
   - Ensures numerical operations and statistics can be performed.

3. **Target variable cleanup**
   - The `class` column was categorical (`pos`, `neg`).
   - Converted into a binary integer:
     - `pos` â†’ `1` (failure)
     - `neg` â†’ `0` (normal)

4. **Table versions created (Python / PySpark)**
   - `df_clean_long` â†’ numeric conversion.
   - `df_clean_final` â†’ final dataset with binary target.

5. **Table versions created (SQL / Databricks tables)**
   - `aps_all` â†’ combined training & test dataset.
   - `aps_all_clean` â†’ NA â†’ null cleaning.
   - `aps_all_clean_long` â†’ numeric conversion.
   - `aps_clean_final` â†’ final cleaned dataset with binary target.

## âœ… Current Status
- Dataset is fully cleaned and standardized.  
- Ready for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** phase.
