# Pyspark_Scania_aps_failure_anaytics_project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This project analyzes the Air Pressure System (APS) dataset from Scania trucks using PySpark.
The primary focus is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), advanced analytics, and data engineering techniques.

The dataset contains sensor readings and system indicators collected from heavy-duty truck engines, with the target of predicting whether a truck will experience a component failure that requires replacement. Since the dataset consists mostly of numeric fields without clear dimensions, it is treated as a fact-style dataset and explored through summarization, aggregations, and statistical profiling.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Approach the dataset from a data analytics and data warehousing perspective.

Demonstrate an end-to-end pipeline using Databricks (PySpark + SQL) for data preparation and exploration.

Perform EDA to extract insights in a structured way.

Replicate and communicate the same insights through Tableau dashboards for visualization and storytelling.

ðŸ”‘ Emphasis

Understanding the dataset structure.

Cleaning and preparing it for analysis.

Answering meaningful, business-style questions.

Building reproducible visualizations that can be shared with stakeholders.

âœ… Outcomes

By the end of this project, the deliverables will include:

A clean, analytics-ready dataset.

A set of analytical insights from PySpark in Databricks.

A Tableau dashboard that ties everything together.
